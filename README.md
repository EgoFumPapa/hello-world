DIYLC/Guitar Wiring Schematics/Effects Pedal ladder diagrams/Miscellanous circuit ladder diagrams
I like Propagandhi and Ibanez MIJ Skunk strype Wizard Necks.  I like building guiitar pedals and trying different pedals and testing how different IC's and semiconductors sound in my effects pedal circuits.  I'm into progressive music.  Propagandhi is my fav baand of all time.  I love Voivod.  I love Death. Dream Theater.  Rush.  On and on.  So, I like me some high gain circuits.  Not like "nu-metal" or "djent" (not sure what djent is) not "chug chgachgachga ch ch chug boowwweeeee" type stuff, but a high gain and a good tone that can retain note clarity under high gain with complex chords, I do like making booowwweeeeee's with some pinch harmonics, though.  Latest in pedals for me - I bought the insanely affordable g1on multi-effects pedal by zoom?  It surprised the shit outta me, it's fucking great.  If you own it, hook it up to some desktop PC speakers with a 3.5mm to 1/4' adapter and play.  You're welcome.
